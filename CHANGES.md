# Summary of changes

## v0.1.0

A new login screen was added, with a new template and static assets structure. All templates now must have their on
`<body></body>` tags and their respective styling sheets and javascript files. 

This is far away from a ideal and optimized structure, but this is the first part of a "componentization" of templates.
